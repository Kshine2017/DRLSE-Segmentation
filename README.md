## Abstract
The proposed algorithm creates active contour based on Level Set Evolution principles without re-initialization step needed. 
There are 2 versions created: 1 matrix detector (DRLSE_segment_1m.m) and 2 matrix detectors (DRLSE_segment_2m.m). 
This function works well with images which contain many small details. 
Its results' accuracy is heavily based on input parameters.

## Implementation info
Implementation is based on this scientific paper:
